# Proxies

Proxies allow us to define JS objects in a way that were impossible before.

---

Proxies are lower level functionality introduced as a part of **ES6, **By that They alter the default behaviour of Javascript by a wrapper function called **Traps** aka Proxy handlers. These handlers has an opportunity to perform extra logic on top of native function before forwarding to the original target/wrapped object.

Again as I discribed above, _Proxies an_ Ability to modify the default behaviour of Javascript within itself is one of the ingredient that amuses me toward Javascript.
