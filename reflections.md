# Reflections

An non-construct built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations

---

Reflections are all about Reflection through introspection - used to discover very low-level information about your code helping with forwarding default operations from the handler to the target. It goes hand in hand with proxies which is all about Reflection through intercession - wrapping Object and intercepting their behavior through traps.

_**Just Making things cleare !!!**_

* Reflect is not a functional Object
* Reflect doesn't have a \[\[Construct\]\] internal method
* It is not possible to use the Reflect Object with the `new`  Operatior
* Reflect Object doesn't have a \[\[Call\]\] internal method
